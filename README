This is a project for the STM8S103 (or STM8S105) to be a controller for an
LCD that is 320x240. Mine happens to be an Emerging Technology device, but
there are probably many that use the same signals.

The STM8S103 has 8KB of program flash and 1KB of RAM. Obviously there is not
enough memory to store the graphic display. But there is enough for a text
framebuffer that is 20 lines of 40 columns. And there is enough CPU speed
to send 80 4-bit nybbles every 60 microseconds to keep the LCD refreshed.

The font map is 256 characters, 12 pixels high and 8 wide. 96 are the usual
ASCII characters. Six are line segments and corners for drawing rectangles.
And 64 characters are pseudo-graphic building blocks with the 12x8 characters
divided into six blocks of 4 pixels square. The library includes a function
to plot these dots anywhere in the 80x60 dot area of the LCD. The rest of 
the characters are available for anything you wish.

This project contains two of my other STM8 libraries. I have included them
here so you don't have to download and build my library collection just to
use two of them. (But please feel free to do so if you like.)

The "fontedit" tool is not mine. I have included it for your convenience.

Please visit the Github wiki for the latest information.

Questions and comments welcome. I am also available for software projects.
